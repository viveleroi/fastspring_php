This class is currently in development but is open for use and contributions.



Generating a link to a Fastspring product called "myproduct"
----------

$fs = new Fastspring('mycompany');
$fs->link('myproduct);

If you're developing, you may append the test parameter:

$fs = new Fastspring('mycompany', 'test');
$fs->link('myproduct);

(You may also call $fs->url() directly to avoid any html)



Generating a basic form to a Fastspring product called "myproduct"
----------

$fs = new Fastspring('mycompany');
$fs->form('myproduct);



Generating an advanced form to a Fastspring product called "myproduct"
----------

$products = array('myproduct'=>'My Product');

$fs = new Fastspring('mycompany');
$fs->form_adv($products);


Other Methods Available
----------

addParameter - Adds a new query string or hidden input parameter

setLinktype - Change between "instant" or "product" link types (URLs only)
